name: Secure Sign Custom Enterprise Contract Policy

description: >-
  Based on the standard Red Hat (non hermetic) policy
  (see https://github.com/enterprise-contract/config/blob/main/redhat-no-hermetic/policy.yaml)
  but with one additional data source providing additional trusted tasks. Currently this is a POC
  demonstrating how to provide additional trusted task references for EC. It's based on a real
  world example from the securesign team, but not actually used for real. Created originally
  for https://issues.redhat.com/browse/EC-147 .

      # references that are also considered trusted under the `trusted_tasks` top level key.
